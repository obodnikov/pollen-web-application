# CLAUDE.md â€“ AI Coding Guidelines

## Purpose
Defines coding rules for AI assistants to ensure consistent and clean web application code.

---

## Rules
1. Do **not** generate HTML with inline CSS or JavaScript.  
2. Place all CSS in dedicated `.css` files.  
3. Place all JavaScript in dedicated `.js` files.  
4. Existing project files are already cleaned â€” do **not** re-clean them.  
5. Use semantic HTML5, ES6+ JavaScript, and modular CSS.  
6. Never include real secrets â€” always use placeholders or environment variables.  
7. **Keep JavaScript files small** â€” not larger than ~800 lines. Break into modules if needed.

## Summary
- **Separate HTML, CSS, JS**  
- **Respect project structure**  
- **Use clean, modern code**  
- **Limit JS files to ~800 lines**
